# Systemd, systemctl e gestione servizi
Comprendere cos'è systemd e systemctl

### systemd

* **What it is:** The *init system* and service manager itself.
* **What it does:**
  * Boots the system (PID 1)
  * Starts/stops services
  * Manages dependencies, sockets, timers, mounts, etc.

* **Think of it as:** the **engine** running your Linux system.

### systemctl

* **What it is:** The **command-line tool** you use to talk to systemd.
* **What it does:** Sends commands *to* systemd.
* **Think of it as:** the **remote control** for the engine.

### Common examples

```bash
systemctl start nginx
systemctl stop nginx
systemctl status nginx
systemctl enable nginx
```

All of those commands are **systemctl** telling **systemd** what to do.

### Analogy

* **systemd** → the manager running the restaurant
* **systemctl** → the walkie-talkie you use to give orders

| Role        | Manages the system        | Controls systemd        |
| Runs always | Yes                       | Only when you invoke it |
